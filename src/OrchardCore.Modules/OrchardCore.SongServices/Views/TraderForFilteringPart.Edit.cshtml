@* As you can see the model here is the view model object this time not a ShapeViewModel<T>. *@

@model TraderForFilteringPartViewModel
@using OrchardCore.SongServices.ViewModels;

@* Nothing special here regarding the editor fields. However, notice that the Biography (ContentField) editor is not
    here, because (as mentioned) it has its own editor and display shape so no need to worry about that. *@

<fieldset class="form-group" asp-validation-class-for="Name">
    <label asp-for="Name">@T["Name"] <span asp-validation-for="Name"></span></label>
    <input asp-for="Name" class="form-control" />
    <span class="hint">@T["Trader's name"]</span>
</fieldset>

@* NEXT STATION: Go back to Drivers/PersonPartDisplayDriver and find the UpdateAsync method. *@
